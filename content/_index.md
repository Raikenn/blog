# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Iâ€™m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a degree in Ethical Hacking (with honours, no less!) that I spent four years diving deep into. I also hold the CREST CPSA certification, which means Iâ€™m pretty serious about penetration testing and security.

After a year working at an IT cyber startupâ€”where I got my hands dirty with real-world challengesâ€”Iâ€™m now teaming up with law enforcement on a cyber contract. My role? Finding weaknesses through penetration testing and beefing up security to keep things locked down tight.

I love the thrill of outsmarting cyber threats and helping organizations stay safe in an ever-changing digital world. When it comes to security, Iâ€™m all in.
